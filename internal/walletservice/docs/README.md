# Wallet Service

The Wallet Service provides centralized wallet management functionality for the Neo Service Layer. It allows for the secure storage, management, and interaction with Neo N3 wallets, handling all wallet-related operations for other services.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this service is to:

1. Centralize wallet management operations in a single service
2. Provide secure storage of wallets and private keys
3. Facilitate signing and verification operations
4. Allow services to request wallet-related actions without direct key access
5. Manage multiple wallets for different service roles

## Design Principles

- **Security First**: Private keys are securely stored and never exposed unnecessarily
- **Centralization**: All wallet operations go through this service 
- **Minimum Privilege**: Services only have access to the specific wallet operations they need
- **Audit Trail**: All wallet operations are logged for security audit purposes
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates with existing Neo-Go wallet functionality

## Core Functionality

- Wallet creation, opening, and management
- Account creation and management within wallets
- Transaction signing (without exposing private keys)
- Message signing and verification
- Wallet backup and restoration
- Role-based wallet assignment (separate wallets for different services)
- Multi-signature wallet support

## Service Interface

The service exposes the following key interfaces:

1. **Wallet Management**
   - Create/Open/Close wallet
   - List available wallets
   - Backup/Restore wallet
   - Add/Remove accounts
   - Get wallet details (without exposing private keys)

2. **Signing Operations**
   - Sign transaction
   - Sign arbitrary message
   - Verify signature

3. **Account Management**
   - Create new account
   - List accounts in wallet
   - Get account details
   - Get account balance

## Integration with Other Services

The Wallet Service integrates with:

- **Transaction Service**: Provides signing capability for transactions
- **GasBank Service**: Manages wallets for gas allocation
- **PriceFeed Service**: Uses dedicated wallets for publishing price data
- **Automation Service**: Provides wallets for contract automation operations

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Storage**: Private keys are stored encrypted at rest
2. **Access Control**: Only authorized services can perform sensitive operations
3. **Isolation**: Wallet operations are isolated from other services
4. **Audit Logging**: All wallet access and operations are logged
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protects against brute force attacks

## Configuration

The service can be configured with:

- Wallet storage location
- Encryption settings
- Default network settings
- Access control rules
- Auto-unlock policies

## Error Handling

The service provides detailed error handling for:

- Authentication failures
- Wallet not found
- Insufficient funds
- Network issues
- Invalid signatures

## Dependencies

- Neo-Go SDK
- Secure storage mechanism
- Cryptographic libraries

## Implementation Details

The implementation will use Neo-Go's wallet package for core wallet functionality while adding:

- Additional security layers
- Service-oriented interfaces
- Centralized management capability
- Role-based access control
