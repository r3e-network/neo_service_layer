# Sandbox Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The JavaScript execution sandbox has been refactored to improve maintainability, readability, and testability. The original large `sandbox.go` file has been broken down into several smaller files, each with a specific responsibility.

## File Structure

The refactored code is organized as follows:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sandbox.go` | Core sandbox functionality and VM lifecycle management |
| `config.go` | Configuration structures and defaults |
| `models.go` | Data models for input, output, and context |
| `memory.go` | Memory monitoring and management |
| `execution.go` | Code execution and runtime management |
| `context.go` | Function context creation and service bindings |
| `services.go` | Service client interfaces and integration |
| `json.go` | JSON utility functions for serialization |

## Key Changes

1. **Memory Management**:
   - Improved memory monitoring with a dedicated `MemoryMonitor` type
   - Added proper synchronization for concurrent access
   - Converted memory values from `int64` to `uint64` for consistency

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Added specific error types for different failure scenarios
   - Improved error reporting and context

3. **Service Integration**:
   - Created clean interfaces for service clients
   - Implemented a more flexible method for binding Go services to JavaScript
   - Added proper validation for service methods

4. **Configuration**:
   - Made configuration more flexible with fluent-style setters
   - Added validation for configuration values

5. **Testing**:
   - Added a build script for validation
   - Improved modularity enables better unit testing

## Migration Guide

### For Direct Users of the Sandbox

If you've been using the sandbox directly, you'll need to update your imports and make some minor changes to your code:

```go
// Old code
import "github.com/r3e-network/neo_service_layer/internal/services/functions/runtime"

// New code
import "github.com/r3e-network/neo_service_layer/internal/services/functions/runtime/sandbox"
```

The new sandbox API is similar but has some differences:

```go
// Old code
sb := runtime.NewSandbox(config)
output, err := sb.Execute(ctx, input)

// New code
sb := sandbox.New(config)
output := sb.Execute(ctx, input)
// Check output.Error for execution errors
```

### For Wrapper Implementation

A wrapper implementation has been created in `sandbox_wrapper.go` to maintain backward compatibility with the original sandbox API. This wrapper translates between the old and new data structures.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive unit tests for each component
2. Consider using a builder pattern for complex object construction
3. Add more detailed documentation for each component
4. Implement more sophisticated memory and resource management
5. Consider adding support for WebAssembly as an alternative execution engine
