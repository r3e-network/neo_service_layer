# Price Feed Service Design

## Overview
The Price Feed Service is responsible for providing reliable price data to the Neo N3 blockchain. It is specifically designed for the Neo ecosystem.

## Core Components

### 1. Price Aggregator
- Collects price data from multiple sources
- Applies statistical analysis for outlier detection
- Calculates weighted averages based on source reliability
- Executes in TEE for secure price computation

### 2. Data Source Connectors
- Supports multiple price data providers
- Implements standardized interface for each source
- Handles rate limiting and API quotas
- Monitors source reliability and latency

### 3. Publishing Manager
- Manages on-chain price updates
- Implements heartbeat checks
- Handles deviation thresholds
- Manages gas costs for updates

### 4. Heartbeat Monitor
- Ensures regular price updates
- Triggers updates on deviation thresholds
- Monitors feed health
- Generates alerts for stale data

## Data Flow

1. Data Collection
   ```
   Data Sources -> Connectors -> Price Aggregator
   ```

2. Price Calculation
   ```
   Price Aggregator -> TEE -> Validated Price
   ```

3. Publishing
   ```
   Validated Price -> Publishing Manager -> Neo N3 Blockchain
   ```

## Security Measures

### TEE Protection
- Price calculations executed in TEE
- Source credentials protected
- Signing keys secured

### Data Validation
- Multiple source verification
- Outlier detection
- Threshold checking
- Signature verification

## Smart Contract Integration

### Price Feed Contract
- Stores latest prices
- Manages feed permissions
- Handles access control
- Emits price update events

### Consumer Interface
```go
type IPriceFeed interface {
    GetLatestPrice(symbol string) (price *big.Int, timestamp uint64, err error)
    GetHistoricalPrice(symbol string, timestamp uint64) (price *big.Int, err error)
    GetPriceWithDeviation(symbol string, maxDeviation *big.Int) (price *big.Int, timestamp uint64, err error)
}
```

## Configuration

### Price Feeds
```yaml
feeds:
  - symbol: "NEO/USD"
    sources:
      - name: "binance"
        weight: 0.3
      - name: "huobi"
        weight: 0.3
      - name: "okex"
        weight: 0.4
    heartbeat: "1m"
    deviation: "0.5%"
    decimals: 8
```

### Update Rules
```yaml
rules:
  min_sources: 3
  update_threshold: "1%"
  max_delay: "5m"
  gas_limit: 1000000
```

## Error Handling

### Source Failures
- Automatic source rotation
- Minimum source requirement
- Fallback data sources
- Alert generation

### Network Issues
- Retry mechanism
- Circuit breaker
- State recovery
- Error reporting

## Monitoring

### Metrics
- Price deviation
- Update frequency
- Source reliability
- Gas consumption
- Response times

### Alerts
- Price anomalies
- Source failures
- Network issues
- Gas issues
- Contract errors

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
