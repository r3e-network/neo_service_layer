# Automation Service Documentation

## Overview

The Automation Service provides contract automation capabilities for the Neo Service Layer, similar to Chainlink Keeper functionality. It enables automated execution of smart contract functions based on predefined conditions and schedules.

## Core Components

### Service

The main service that coordinates all automation functionality:
- Manages upkeeps (registration, cancellation, pausing)
- Coordinates execution of upkeeps
- Handles gas allocation through GasBank
- Maintains performance history

### Upkeep

An upkeep represents an automated task with:
- Target contract and function
- Execution conditions
- Gas requirements
- Performance history

### Scheduler

Manages the timing of upkeep executions:
- Schedules upkeep checks
- Handles retry logic
- Manages execution windows

### Checker

Validates if an upkeep should be executed:
- Checks conditions
- Validates gas requirements
- Ensures proper timing

### Performer

Executes upkeeps when conditions are met:
- Calls target contracts
- Manages gas usage
- Records performance metrics

## Usage

### Registering an Upkeep

```go
upkeep := &automation.Upkeep{
    Name:           "My Upkeep",
    TargetContract: contractAddress,
    ExecuteGas:     200000,
    UpkeepFunction: "updateData",
    CheckData:      []byte("check data"),
    Status:         "active",
}

success, err := service.RegisterUpkeep(ctx, ownerAddress, upkeep)
```

### Managing Upkeeps

```go
// Pause an upkeep
success, err := service.PauseUpkeep(ctx, ownerAddress, upkeepID)

// Resume an upkeep
success, err := service.ResumeUpkeep(ctx, ownerAddress, upkeepID)

// Cancel an upkeep
success, err := service.CancelUpkeep(ctx, ownerAddress, upkeepID)
```

### Monitoring Performance

```go
// Get upkeep details
upkeep, err := service.GetUpkeep(ctx, upkeepID)

// Get performance history
performances, err := service.GetUpkeepPerformance(ctx, upkeepID)
```

## Configuration

The service can be configured with:
- Check interval
- Retry attempts and delay
- Gas buffer
- Keeper registry address

## Best Practices

1. **Gas Management**
   - Set appropriate gas limits
   - Monitor gas usage
   - Maintain sufficient gas balance

2. **Upkeep Design**
   - Keep check functions lightweight
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Use appropriate intervals

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track performance metrics
   - Monitor success rates
   - Set up alerts for failures

4. **Security**
   - Validate upkeep ownership
   - Control access to functions
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

## Integration with Other Services

The Automation Service integrates with:
- GasBank for gas management
- Functions service for execution
- Trigger service for conditions
- Neo blockchain for contract interaction
