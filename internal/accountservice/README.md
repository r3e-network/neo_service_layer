# Account Service

## Overview
The Account Service provides an abstraction layer for managing Neo N3 accounts within the service layer. It handles account-related operations, signature verification, and integration with other services while maintaining security and proper permission control.

## Features
- Account abstraction and management
- Signature verification for transactions
- Integration with Gas Bank service for gas management
- Integration with Secrets service for secure key management
- Support for smart contract wallets
- Batch transaction handling
- Account recovery mechanisms

## Architecture

### Components
1. **Account Manager**
   - Manages account lifecycle
   - Handles account creation and updates
   - Maintains account metadata

2. **Signature Verifier**
   - Verifies transaction signatures
   - Supports multiple signature schemes
   - Integrates with Neo N3 cryptography

3. **Transaction Handler**
   - Processes transaction requests
   - Manages transaction batching
   - Handles transaction prioritization

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Connects with Gas Bank service
   - Interfaces with Secrets service
   - Integrates with other Neo service layer components

## API Endpoints
- POST /v1/accounts/create - Create new abstract account
- GET /v1/accounts/{address} - Get account details
- POST /v1/accounts/{address}/transactions - Submit transaction
- GET /v1/accounts/{address}/transactions - Get transaction history
- POST /v1/accounts/batch - Submit batch transactions

## Security Considerations
- All operations require proper signature verification
- Integration with TEE for sensitive operations
- Strict permission control for account operations
- Secure key management through Secrets service

## Metrics
- Account creation rate
- Transaction success/failure rate
- Signature verification latency
- Gas usage patterns
- Integration service response times

## Dependencies
- Neo N3 SDK
- Gas Bank Service
- Secrets Service
- TEE Runtime

## Configuration
```yaml
account:
  maxBatchSize: 50
  defaultGasLimit: 1000
  signatureTimeout: 60s
  recoveryWindow: 24h
  teeRequired: true
```
