# Neo Service Layer Implementation Summary

## Completed Components

### 1. JavaScript Sandbox for Functions Service

We've implemented a secure JavaScript execution environment for the Functions Service, including:

- **Sandbox Environment**: A secure execution container for JavaScript code using the Goja engine.
- **Resource Controls**: Configurable limits on memory usage, execution time, and stack size.
- **Console API**: Logging capabilities via console.log, console.error, etc.
- **Function Execution**: Support for synchronous and asynchronous function execution.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for timeouts, syntax errors, and runtime exceptions.
- **JSON Interface**: Support for JSON-serialized inputs and outputs.

### 2. Functions Service API

We've created a comprehensive Functions Service API with the following features:

- **Function Management**: Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting serverless functions.
- **Versioning**: Automatic versioning of function code changes.
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained access control for function invocation.
- **Execution Tracking**: Recording and querying function execution history.
- **Resource Management**: Limits on function size, memory usage, and execution time.

### 3. Secrets Service

We've implemented a Secrets Service for secure storage of sensitive information:

- **Encryption**: AES-GCM encryption for all stored secrets.
- **Access Control**: Secrets are tied to user addresses and only accessible by their owners.
- **Expiration**: Support for time-to-live (TTL) on secrets.
- **Metadata**: Additional attributes for secret management.

### 4. Integration Tests

We've created comprehensive tests for the new services:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing the JavaScript sandbox functionality.
- **Integration Tests**: Testing the Functions and Secrets services working together.
- **Permissions Testing**: Validating access control for functions.
- **Documentation**: Updated README files with usage examples and configuration details.

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Runtime Support**: Extend the sandbox to support additional runtimes beyond JavaScript.
2. **External Service Integration**: Add support for accessing external services from functions.
3. **Metrics and Monitoring**: Enhance the metrics collection for function executions.
4. **Advanced Scheduling**: Implement cron-like scheduling for function execution.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting and quota management for function invocations.
6. **Event-Driven Execution**: Enable functions to be triggered by blockchain events.

## Testing

Run the unit tests for the sandbox:
```
go test -v ./internal/services/functions/runtime/...
```

Run the integration tests for the new services:
```
go test -v ./tests/integration/simple_test.go ./tests/integration/phase5_test.go
```
