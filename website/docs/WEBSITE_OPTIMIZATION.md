# Neo Service Layer Website Optimization Plan

This document outlines our approach to addressing the current issues with the Neo Service Layer website, including slow build times, layout problems, style inconsistencies, and missing pages.

## Current Issues

1. **Performance Issues**
   - Slow build times due to multiple UI frameworks
   - Mixing of Pages Router and App Router
   - Missing dependencies
   - Unoptimized assets

2. **Layout and Style Issues**
   - Inconsistent styling due to multiple frameworks
   - Responsive design problems
   - Animation performance issues
   - Theme inconsistencies

3. **Missing Pages**
   - Incomplete site structure
