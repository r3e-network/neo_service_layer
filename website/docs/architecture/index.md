# Architecture Overview

The Neo Service Layer is built with a modular, microservices-based architecture that emphasizes:

## Core Principles

- **Reliability**: Multiple data sources, sophisticated filtering, and fallback mechanisms
- **Security**: TEE integration, secure key management, and robust input validation
- **Performance**: Efficient caching, batching, and optimized blockchain interactions
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics, logging, and alerting systems
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure, thorough documentation, and automated testing
