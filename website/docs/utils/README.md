# Utility Functions Documentation

## Overview
The utility functions provide core functionality for the Neo Service Layer, handling everything from TEE integration to logging. Each utility is designed with security, performance, and reliability in mind.

## Available Utilities

### [TEE Integration](./tee.md)
Handles all Trusted Execution Environment operations:
- Secure encryption/decryption
- Attestation management
- Key generation and rotation

### [Neo N3 Utilities](./neo.md)
Provides Neo N3 blockchain-specific functionality:
- Address formatting and validation
- Contract hash validation
- Script hash conversion

### [Vault Management](./vault.md)
Manages secure storage of secrets:
- Secret CRUD operations
- Access logging
- Key rotation
- Metrics tracking

### [Authentication](./auth.md)
Handles authentication and verification:
- Signature verification
- Neo N3 address validation

### [Logging](./logger.md)
Provides structured logging capabilities:
- Multiple log levels
- Contextual logging
- Timestamp tracking

## Best Practices
1. Always use TEE for sensitive operations
2. Validate all blockchain-related inputs
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Log appropriate information for debugging
5. Rotate keys regularly
6. Monitor access patterns

## Error Handling
All utilities follow consistent error handling patterns:
- Specific error types for different scenarios
- Detailed error messages
- Proper error propagation
- Logging of errors with context

## Testing
Each utility has comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for complex operations
- Mock implementations for external services
- Error case testing

## Security Considerations
1. All sensitive data must be processed in TEE
2. Validate all inputs before processing
3. Use proper key management
4. Implement access controls
5. Monitor for suspicious activity

## Performance
The utilities are optimized for:
- Minimal latency
- Efficient resource usage
- Scalability
- Proper caching where appropriate

## Contributing
When adding or modifying utilities:
1. Follow existing patterns
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Update documentation
4. Consider security implications
5. Review performance impact
