# Neo Service Layer

The Neo Service Layer is an enterprise-grade infrastructure solution that provides essential services for building and maintaining decentralized applications on the Neo N3 blockchain. This documentation provides an overview of the architecture, services, and implementation details.

## Architecture Overview

Neo Service Layer operates as a centralized, trusted oracle network specifically designed for Neo N3. The architecture consists of several key components:

### Core Components

1. **Service API Layer**: HTTP/WebSocket interfaces for client applications
2. **Authentication Layer**: Signature verification and request validation
3. **Service Implementation Layer**: Core business logic for each service
4. **Blockchain Interface Layer**: Communication with Neo N3 blockchain
5. **TEE Runtime Environment**: Secure execution environment for sensitive operations

### Security Model

All sensitive operations within the Neo Service Layer are executed within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing strong security guarantees:

- **Data Confidentiality**: Data processed within the TEE remains encrypted and inaccessible
- **Code Integrity**: Execution code cannot be tampered with
- **Verifiable Execution**: All operations include cryptographic proofs of correct execution
- **Remote Attestation**: Third-party verification of TEE integrity

## Service Descriptions

### Price Feed Service

The Price Feed service provides real-time and historical price data for various blockchain assets. It aggregates data from multiple trusted sources, validates the data, and makes it available to smart contracts and applications.

## Integration Guide

### Client SDK

The Neo Service Layer provides client SDKs for easy integration:

```javascript
import { NeoServiceLayer } from 'neo-service-layer';

// Initialize the client
const client = new NeoServiceLayer({
  network: 'mainnet', // or 'testnet'
  signMessage: async (message) => {
    // Implement signature using your wallet provider
    return signature;
  }
});

// Use services
const priceFeed = client.priceFeed;
const automation = client.automation;
const gasBank = client.gasBank;
// ...
```

### Authentication

All requests to the Neo Service Layer require cryptographic signatures to prove ownership of the Neo N3 address making the request. This eliminates the need for traditional username/password authentication.

### Service Interaction Patterns

#### Request-Response

Standard HTTP requests for immediate operations:

```javascript
// Get the current price of NEO/USD
const price = await client.priceFeed.getPrice('NEO/USD');
```

#### Subscriptions

WebSocket-based subscriptions for real-time updates:

```javascript
// Subscribe to price updates
const subscription = await client.priceFeed.subscribe('NEO/USD', (update) => {
  console.log('New price:', update.price);
});

// Later, unsubscribe
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

#### Long-running Operations

Creation and management of persistent tasks:

```javascript
// Create an automation task
const task = await client.automation.createTask({
  name: 'Price Update',
  contract: 'YOUR_CONTRACT_HASH',
  method: 'updatePrice',
  schedule: '*/30 * * * *',
  params: ['NEO/USD'],
});

// Later, update the task
await client.automation.updateTask(task.id, {
  schedule: '0 */1 * * *', // Change to hourly
});
```

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Signatures

All operations that modify state or access sensitive information require client-side signatures. This ensures that only the rightful owner can perform these operations.

### TEE Guarantees

Operations executed within the TEE provide strong security guarantees, but users should understand the limitations:

- TEE attestation should be verified for critical operations
- Side-channel attacks remain a theoretical possibility
- Hardware-level vulnerabilities may exist

### Best Practices

1. **Verify attestations** for critical operations
2. **Rotate secrets** regularly
3. **Monitor activity** for unexpected operations
4. **Use minimal access** principles for TEE functions
5. **Implement additional verification** for high-value operations

## Performance and Scaling

The Neo Service Layer is designed for high performance and reliability:

- Distributed architecture for horizontal scaling
