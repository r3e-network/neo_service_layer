# Neo Service Layer - Services Documentation

This directory contains all the service implementations for the Neo Service Layer. Each service is organized in its own directory with a consistent structure.

## Service Directory Structure

```

## Common Service Structure

Each service directory follows this structure:
```
service-name/
├── components/        # UI components
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/            # Utility functions
├── api/              # API route handlers
├── constants.ts      # Service constants
├── page.tsx          # Service main page
└── README.md         # Service documentation
```

## Authentication

- No traditional login/registration
- Uses signed message authentication
- Implements signature verification
- Manages session tokens
- Handles permission validation

## Contract Automation

Similar to Chainlink Keeper:
- Automated contract execution
- Event-based triggers
- Condition monitoring
- Gas optimization
- Execution verification

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep service code isolated
   - Use shared utilities when appropriate
   - Maintain consistent file structure
   - Document service interfaces

2. **Security**
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Validate all inputs
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Log security events

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize resource usage
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Monitor service metrics
   - Handle high load scenarios

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests
   - Implement integration tests
   - Test error scenarios
   - Validate security measures

5. **Documentation**
   - Document all APIs
   - Maintain usage examples
   - Update documentation regularly
   - Include setup instructions

## Service Integration

Services can interact with each other through:
1. Direct method calls (same process)
2. Event system (pub/sub)
3. API calls (cross-process)
4. Message queue (async operations)

## Deployment

Each service should:
- Be independently deployable
- Have proper health checks
- Include monitoring endpoints
- Support graceful shutdown
- Handle configuration management

## Error Handling

Services should:
- Log all errors appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Implement proper fallbacks
- Monitor error rates

## Metrics and Monitoring

Each service should expose:
- Health metrics
- Performance metrics
- Resource usage
- Error rates
- Custom service metrics
