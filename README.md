## Getting Started

1. Install the SDK:
   ```bash
   npm install @neo-service-layer/core
   # or
   yarn add @neo-service-layer/core
   ```

2. Initialize the client with your Neo N3 wallet:
   ```typescript
   import { Client } from '@neo-service-layer/core';

   const client = new Client({
     signMessage: async (message) => {
       // Sign message using your Neo N3 wallet
       return signature;
     }
   });
   ```

3. Use the services:
   ```typescript
   // Get price data
   const priceFeed = new PriceFeed(client);
   const price = await priceFeed.getPrice('NEO/USD');

   // Create automation task
   const automation = new Automation(client);
   await automation.createTask({
     name: 'Price Update',
     contract: 'YOUR_CONTRACT_HASH',
     method: 'updatePrice',
     schedule: '*/30 * * * *',
     params: [price],
   });
   ```
