# Transaction Service Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the test plan for the Neo Service Layer transaction service. It covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for all transaction service functionality, with a focus on ensuring reliability, correctness, and performance.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components of the transaction service in isolation.

#### 1.1 Service Interface Tests

- **Purpose**: Verify that the transaction service interface is properly defined and implemented.
- **Test File**: `internal/services/transaction/interface_test.go`
- **Test Cases**:
  - Verify that the mock service implements the Service interface
  - Test each method of the Service interface with mock implementations
  - Test error handling for each method

#### 1.2 Service Implementation Tests

- **Purpose**: Verify that the transaction service implementation works correctly.
- **Test File**: `internal/services/transaction/service_implementation_test.go`
- **Test Cases**:
  - Test transaction creation with valid and invalid configurations
  - Test transaction signing with valid and invalid transaction IDs
  - Test transaction sending with signed and unsigned transactions
  - Test transaction status retrieval with valid and invalid transaction hashes
  - Test transaction details retrieval with valid and invalid transaction IDs
  - Test transaction listing with various filter criteria
  - Test fee estimation with valid and invalid configurations
  - Test error handling for all methods

#### 1.3 Transaction Lifecycle Tests

- **Purpose**: Verify that transactions can progress through their entire lifecycle.
- **Test File**: `internal/services/transaction/service_implementation_test.go`
- **Test Cases**:
  - Create, sign, send, and check the status of a transaction
  - Verify that transaction status updates correctly at each stage
  - Test transaction cancellation and error recovery

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests focus on testing the interaction between the transaction service and other components of the Neo Service Layer.

#### 2.1 Sandbox Integration Tests

- **Purpose**: Verify that the transaction service is properly integrated with the sandbox environment.
- **Test File**: `internal/services/functions/runtime/sandbox_transaction_test.go`
- **Test Cases**:
  - Test that JavaScript functions can call transaction service methods
  - Test that transaction service methods return the expected results
  - Test error handling for all methods
  - Test that transaction service methods are properly exposed in the function context

#### 2.2 Memory Monitoring Tests

- **Purpose**: Verify that the memory monitoring functionality works correctly and doesn't cause race conditions or deadlocks.
- **Test File**: `internal/services/functions/runtime/sandbox_memory_test.go`
- **Test Cases**:
  - Test that memory monitoring starts and stops correctly
  - Test that memory monitoring detects when memory limits are exceeded
  - Test that memory monitoring doesn't cause race conditions or deadlocks
  - Test that memory monitoring works correctly with concurrent access

### 3. End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests focus on testing the entire system from the user's perspective.

#### 3.1 JavaScript Function Tests

- **Purpose**: Verify that JavaScript functions can use the transaction service to create, sign, send, and manage transactions.
- **Test File**: `internal/services/functions/runtime/sandbox_transaction_test.go`
- **Test Cases**:
  - Test a complete transaction lifecycle from JavaScript
  - Test error handling from JavaScript
  - Test that transaction service methods work correctly with various input parameters

## Test Environment

### Local Development Environment

- **Purpose**: Run unit tests and integration tests during development.
- **Configuration**:
  - Use mock implementations for external dependencies
  - Use in-memory storage for transactions
  - Use testnet for blockchain interactions

### CI/CD Environment

- **Purpose**: Run all tests as part of the continuous integration pipeline.
- **Configuration**:
  - Use mock implementations for external dependencies
  - Use in-memory storage for transactions
  - Use testnet for blockchain interactions

### Staging Environment

- **Purpose**: Run end-to-end tests in a production-like environment.
- **Configuration**:
  - Use real implementations for external dependencies
  - Use persistent storage for transactions
  - Use testnet for blockchain interactions

## Test Data

### Mock Transactions

- **Purpose**: Provide consistent test data for unit tests and integration tests.
- **Data**:
  - Transaction configurations for various transaction types
  - Transaction IDs, hashes, and statuses for various transaction states
  - Error cases for testing error handling

### Test Accounts

- **Purpose**: Provide test accounts for signing and sending transactions.
- **Data**:
  - Test wallets with sufficient funds for sending transactions
  - Test accounts with various permission levels

## Test Execution

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
go test -v ./internal/services/transaction/...
```

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
go test -v ./internal/services/functions/runtime/...
```

### Running All Tests

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

### Running Tests with Race Detection

```bash
go test -race -v ./...
```

## Test Reporting

### Test Results

- **Purpose**: Provide visibility into test results.
- **Format**:
  - JUnit XML for CI/CD integration
  - HTML reports for human readability

### Code Coverage

- **Purpose**: Measure test coverage.
- **Format**:
  - Coverage reports in HTML and XML formats
  - Coverage thresholds for CI/CD integration

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

- Add new test cases as new features are added
- Update existing tests as features change
- Ensure that all tests follow the same patterns and conventions

### Test Refactoring

- Refactor tests as needed to improve maintainability
- Extract common test utilities to reduce duplication
- Keep tests focused on specific functionality

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the transaction service in the Neo Service Layer. By following this plan, we can ensure that the transaction service is reliable, correct, and performant, and that it integrates properly with the rest of the system.

## Next Steps

1. Implement all tests described in this plan
2. Run tests with race detection to identify and fix race conditions
3. Measure and improve test coverage
4. Add more specific test cases for edge cases and error conditions
5. Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline
