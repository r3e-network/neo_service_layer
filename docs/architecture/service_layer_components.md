# Neo Service Layer - Service Layer Components

## Service Layer Overview

The Neo Service Layer consists of several core components that work together to provide a comprehensive set of services for the Neo N3 blockchain. Each component is designed with a specific responsibility and interacts with other components through well-defined interfaces.

1. Validates user credentials
2. Issues and validates JWT tokens
3. Manages user roles and permissions
4. Implements OAuth2 flows for third-party integrations
5. Enforces access control policies

### Service Registry

The Service Registry maintains information about available services:

1. Tracks service availability and health
2. Facilitates service discovery
3. Manages service configurations
4. Provides load balancing capabilities

## Service Interactions

Services interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, following these principles:

1. **Loose Coupling**: Services depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
3. **Encapsulation**: Services hide their internal implementation details
4. **Idempotency**: Operations can be safely retried without side effects
5. **Asynchronous Communication**: Services use async/await patterns for non-blocking operations

This architecture provides a flexible, maintainable, and scalable foundation for the Neo Service Layer.
