## Architecture Principles

The Neo Service Layer architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Security First**: Critical operations are performed within secure enclaves
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear, focused responsibility
3. **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
4. **Scalability**: The architecture supports horizontal scaling of components
5. **Resilience**: The system is designed to handle failures gracefully
6. **Observability**: All components provide metrics, logs, and traces for monitoring

## Diagrams

The architecture documentation includes ASCII diagrams to illustrate the system design. These diagrams provide a visual representation of the components and their interactions, making it easier to understand the overall architecture.

Example:

```
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
|                |     |                |     |                |
|  Client        +---->+  API Gateway   +---->+  Service Layer |
|                |     |                |     |                |
+----------------+     +----------------+     +-------+--------+
                                                      |
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                        +-------------+-------------+
                                        |                           |
                                        |  Enclave Services         |
                                        |                           |
                                        +---------------------------+
```

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing components based on this architecture, developers should:

1. Follow the single responsibility principle
2. Program to interfaces, not implementations
3. Use dependency injection for component composition
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
6. Document public APIs and interfaces

## Future Enhancements

The architecture is designed to support future enhancements, including:

1. Multi-enclave support for increased isolation
2. Additional blockchain network integrations
3. Enhanced analytics and monitoring capabilities
4. Expanded function runtime environments
5. Advanced price feed aggregation algorithms
