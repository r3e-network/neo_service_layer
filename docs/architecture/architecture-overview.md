# Neo Service Layer Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The Neo Service Layer is a comprehensive middleware platform designed to provide functionality for the Neo N3 blockchain. It offers a suite of services that enable developers to create, deploy, and manage decentralized applications with enhanced capabilities such as external data integration, automated task execution, and secure function management.

## System Architecture

The Neo Service Layer follows a microservices architecture pattern, with distinct services that handle specific functionalities while communicating through well-defined interfaces. This design allows for better scalability, maintainability, and resilience.

## Core Services

### Functions Service

Manages serverless functions that can be executed in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):

- **Function Creation**: Register new functions with associated metadata
- **Function Execution**: Execute functions with proper isolation and resource constraints
- **Permission Control**: Manage who can execute and modify functions
- **Runtime Environments**: Support for JavaScript, Python, and other languages

[Detailed Functions Service Documentation](../functions-runtime.md)

### Secrets Service

Securely stores and manages sensitive information:

- **Secret Storage**: Encrypt and store sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions for accessing secrets
- **Rotation Policies**: Support for automatic secret rotation
- **Integration**: Allow functions to access secrets with proper permissions

### Gas Bank Service

Manages GAS allocation and usage for operations:

- **Gas Allocation**: Reserve GAS tokens for operations
- **Automated Refills**: Replenish GAS based on configurable thresholds
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor and report on GAS consumption
- **Efficient Pooling**: Optimize GAS usage across multiple operations

### Price Feed Service

Provides reliable price data for various assets:

- **Data Aggregation**: Collect price data from multiple sources
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity and reliability
- **On-chain Publication**: Publish verified price data to blockchain
- **Historical Data**: Maintain and provide access to historical prices

### Trigger Service

Enables event-driven automation:

- **Conditional Triggers**: Execute actions based on predefined conditions
- **Schedule-based Execution**: Time-based triggers using CRON expressions
- **Event Monitoring**: Watch for specific blockchain events
- **Action Execution**: Invoke functions, contracts, or other services when triggered

## Supporting Services

### API Service

Provides RESTful API endpoints for interacting with the platform:

- **Authentication**: Verify user identity through signature-based auth
- **Request Routing**: Direct requests to appropriate services
- **Response Formatting**: Standardize API responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect from abuse and ensure fair usage

### Metrics Service

Collects and reports performance and usage metrics:

- **Service Monitoring**: Track health and performance of all services
- **Usage Statistics**: Collect data on resource utilization
- **Alerting**: Notify of abnormal conditions
- **Dashboards**: Visualize system performance and usage patterns

### Logging Service

Centralizes log collection and analysis:

- **Log Aggregation**: Collect logs from all services
- **Searchable Interface**: Query and analyze logs
- **Log Retention**: Store logs according to configurable policies
- **Structured Logging**: Standardized format for easier analysis

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security

Security is implemented across all services:

- **Authentication**: Signature-based authentication for all API calls
- **Authorization**: Granular permission control for resources
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Isolation**: TEE for sensitive operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events

### Scalability

The architecture is designed for horizontal scalability:

- **Stateless Services**: Services can be scaled independently
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across service instances
- **Resource Management**: Dynamic allocation based on demand
- **Caching**: Strategic caching to reduce load and improve performance

### Reliability

Multiple mechanisms ensure system reliability:

- **Service Redundancy**: Multiple instances of critical services
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Graceful handling of transient failures
- **Health Monitoring**: Proactive detection of issues

## Communication Patterns

Services communicate using several patterns:

- **Synchronous API Calls**: Direct service-to-service communication
- **Asynchronous Messaging**: Event-based communication for operations
- **Webhooks**: Notify external systems of events
- **Blockchain Events**: Monitor and react to on-chain events

## Data Storage

Different storage solutions for different data types:

- **Relational Database**: For structured data with relationship requirements
- **Distributed Cache**: For high-speed access to frequently used data
- **Blockchain Storage**: For data that needs to be publicly verifiable
- **Secure Storage**: For encrypted sensitive information

## Deployment Architecture

The platform can be deployed in various configurations:

- **Docker Containers**: Each service packaged as a container
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Managing service deployment and scaling
- **Cloud-Native**: Support for major cloud providers
- **On-Premises**: Support for private deployment in secure environments

## Integration Points

### Blockchain Integration

- **Neo N3 RPC**: Communication with Neo blockchain nodes
- **Smart Contract Interactions**: Deploy and interact with on-chain contracts
- **Asset Management**: Handle NEO, GAS, and NEP tokens

### External Systems

- **Oracle Data Sources**: Integration with external data providers
- **Web APIs**: Consumption of external web services
- **TEE Attestation**: Verification of trusted execution environments

## Development and Testing

### Development Workflow

- **Service Development**: Independent development of services
- **API-First Design**: Clear API specifications before implementation
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Up-to-date documentation of all components

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Test interaction between services
- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Validate performance under load
