# Neo Service Layer Security

This document outlines the security considerations and implementations in the Neo Service Layer.

## Enclave Security

The Neo Service Layer uses AWS Nitro Enclaves to provide a secure execution environment for sensitive operations. Nitro Enclaves provide:

- Isolated execution environment
- Memory and CPU isolation
- No persistent storage
- No direct network access
- Cryptographic attestation

### Attestation

Attestation is the process of verifying the identity and integrity of an enclave. The Neo Service Layer uses the AWS Nitro Attestation Document to prove the identity and integrity of the enclave to external services.

## Data Security

### Encryption

The Neo Service Layer uses the following encryption mechanisms:

#### Secret Encryption
- AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding
- Unique encryption key for each secret
- Secure random number generation for keys and IVs
- Key derivation using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 for password-based encryption

#### Wallet Encryption
- Private keys are encrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding
- Password-based encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
- Secure random number generation for salt and IVs

### Key Management

- Private keys are never stored in plaintext
- Encryption keys are derived from passwords using secure key derivation
- Unique encryption keys for each secret
- Secure random number generation for keys and IVs

## Access Control

### Account-Based Access Control

- Each secret is associated with an account
- Only the account owner can access the secret
- Account authentication is required for all operations

### Function-Based Access Control

- Secrets can be restricted to specific functions
- Functions must authenticate to access secrets
- Access control checks are performed for all secret operations

## Communication Security

### VSOCK Communication

- VSOCK communication between host and enclave
- Message length prefixing to prevent message boundary issues
- Error handling to prevent information leakage

### External Communication

- HTTPS for all external API calls
- TLS 1.2+ for secure communication
- Certificate validation for all external connections

## Secure Coding Practices

### Input Validation

- All inputs are validated before processing
- Type checking and bounds checking for all inputs
- Error handling to prevent information leakage

### Error Handling

- Exceptions are caught and logged
- Error messages do not reveal sensitive information
- Graceful degradation in case of errors

### Logging

- Sensitive information is not logged
- Log levels are appropriate for the environment
- Logs are structured for easy analysis

## Security Testing

### Unit Testing

- Security-focused unit tests
- Edge case testing
- Error handling testing

### Integration Testing

- End-to-end security testing
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Error handling testing

## Security Recommendations

### Deployment

- Use secure deployment practices
- Keep the enclave image up to date
- Use secure boot and measured boot

### Monitoring

- Monitor enclave health and performance
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- Regularly review logs for security issues

### Incident Response

- Have an incident response plan
- Regularly test the incident response plan
- Have a process for security updates

## Conclusion

The Neo Service Layer is designed with security in mind, using industry best practices for encryption, access control, and secure coding. The use of AWS Nitro Enclaves provides an additional layer of security for sensitive operations.
